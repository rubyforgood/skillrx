# SkillRX
SkillRX is a Ruby on Rails content management application which will allow medical training providers to upload and manage content which will be delivered to Raspberry Pi and other computers in low-resource areas for use by medical professionals at these locations.

The project provides a ground-up rewrite of the [CMES Admin Panel](https://github.com/techieswithoutborders/cmes-admin-panel-next) for [Techies Without Borders](https://techieswithoutborders.us/).

> [CMES](https://cmesworld.org/) is an initiative of Techies without Borders, a global nonprofit focused on harnessing technology for social development. CMES aims to address the difficulty in accessing CME content for medical practitioners in resource-constrained areas of the world, a critical problem in public health. Since its inception in January 2016, the CMES team has distributed over 200 CMES thumb drives to medical doctors and nurses working at remote locations in Nepal, Uganda, Ecuador, Nigeria, St. Lucia and the Oceania region (Fiji,Tonga, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Samoa and Cook Islands).
